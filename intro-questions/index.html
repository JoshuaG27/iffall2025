    <li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</li>

    <p>My name is Josh Guo, a Comm Des and Creative Fiction Writing major, and I am a Junior</p>

    <li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li>

    <p>I have always intended to do UI/UX work with my major, so this class seemed like the natural next step</p>

    <li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li>

    <p>I don't have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS </p>

    <li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li>

    <p>I want to learn how to design and create more interactivity within my work as a whole so I can take projects to the next level</p>

    <li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li>

    <p>designing for the screen needs to be highly responsive and adaptable to the user, while paper doesn't necessarily have that aspect to it</p>

    <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice</li>
    <a href="url">https://www.amazon.com</a>
    <p> I think this is a really effective design because it allows for the user to browse freely but never get lost by providing plenty of signposts and ways to navigate which allow for complicated action flows without confusing the user</p>

   
    <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li>

    <a href="url">https://www.nasa.gov</a>
    <p> I think this is a really effective example of communication because its very easy to navigate, contains a lot of infomration in a limited space, and doesn't overwhelm the user despite that</p>

    <li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li>
    <a href="url">https://open.spotify.com</a>
     <p>I think Spotify works really well because how simple and easy navigable it is even at first glance. It makes for an easy user experience which doesn't feel unpleasant to use</p>
