            <h1>Lemon Basque Cheesecake</h1>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h2>Cheesecake</h2>
<p>8-inch round pan, 600 gram lb 5 oz full-fat cream cheese, 200 gram cup granulated sugar, 200 gram whole eggs, 130 gram cup sour cream, 50 gram Tbsp lemon juice, 130 gram  cup heavy cream, 25 gram Tbsp all-purpose flour, 6 gram tsp flaky sea salt</p>
    <br>
<h2>Sticky Lemons</h2>
<p>2 medium lemons, cut into slices, 100 gram cup light brown sugar, packed, 100 gram Tbsp boiling water </p>
<br>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 450°F.</p>
<p>Step 2: For the cheesecake, mix the cream cheese in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment until evenly combined, then paddle in the sugar until it has dissolved fully. Check with your fingers! It should feel totally smooth.</p>
</p>Step 3: Now, add the eggs, one by one, scraping down the sides of the bowl to make sure they are combined. Finally, add the sour cream, lemon juice, and heavy cream.</p>
<p>Step 4: Sift the flour and add the salt into another bowl, then whisk in a few spoonfuls of the cheesecake batter. This is a liaison batter to help the flour incorporate easily into the cheesecake. Ensure it is smooth before adding it back into the rest of the cheesecake batter. Mix the two batters together, scraping down the sides to make sure it is evenly combined.</p>
<p>Step 5: Prepare the pan by taking two pieces of parchment paper and laying them on top of each other at a perpendicular angle, then pressing them into your baking pan. It should comfortably cover the pan and have a slight collar. You can trim it if it is too dramatic. Pour in the cheesecake mixture and tap against your kitchen counter to level the mixture.</p>
<p>Step 6: For the sticky lemons, put the lemon slices into a shallow baking dish. Sprinkle the sugar over the top, followed by the boiling water. Wrap with foil.</p>
<p></p>Step 7: To bake, put the lemons and cheesecake into the oven at the same time. Bake for 25-35 minutes, until the top of the cheesecake is well browned and the internal temperature reads 140 to 144°F. This temperature will increase 41 to 50°F as it cools thanks to carryover cooking. Let cool and then put in the fridge until totally cold. The cheesecake lasts well in the fridge for 3 to 5 days but is best enjoyed at room temperature.
<p>Step 8: For the sticky lemons, remove the foil once the cheesecake is out and place back into the oven for 5 minutes to brown slightly. Let cool, then store in the fridge until ready to use. You can also rewarm, then add a little boiling water to the syrup to create a sauce—just add 1 large spoonful at a time until it becomes spoonable. Serve alongside the cheesecake.</p>

        <p>This is a pretty well-designed site because all of the important information is being talked about first, allowing you to follow the recupe with little or no extraneous information presented. This is nice because it allows the user to not get lost in things like historical facts about the dessert when they might not care about that sort of information at all.</p>

        <p>I really like how short and simple the design is. The fact that it also provides substitutions for recipe variations you might want to try alongside nutritonal information is really nice and incredibly convenient for the user.</p>

        <p>While I do like how easy it is to follow along, some of the instructions seem a bit vague and it could be easy for someone who's new to baking to get lost. For example, melting butter until its warm but not hot could use a bit of a guideline like how long you should microwave it for, etc. Also it uses a lot of visual cues that someone who is more inexperienced might find hard to understand without picture references included.</p>

        <p>I think the use of bold, eye-catching imagery, combined with short and punchy paragraphs of information really helps to interest the viewer in the subject. It manages to keep the user oriented with the unchanging logo in the center while also presenting products and information in a way which is purposefully meant to immerse the viewer in the content without overwhelming them entirely. I think it manages to handle a vast amount of information both visual and written and wrangle it into something that feels manageable despite the scope of what the site is trying to capture.</p>

        <p>The site is incredibly well designed to feel like an experience, rather than a portfolio. Everything from animations to sound effects is accounted for, allowing for the building of both a world and a story to get the viewer interested. The hero and banner images create initial interest, and the user is delighted when the find that the cursor is used to create changing and animated hoverstates within the page. It is an extremely interactive experience. The interactivity itself is smooth, responsive, and coordinated. The information is presented in a way which retains interest without boring the user, which, combined with the stunning visuals and interactive nature of the experience, allows for greater immersion overall. </p>

        <p>The site is well-designed in the same ways the previous site is, while maintaining a more information-focused approach. The charming visual style and animations lend a role to retaining interest, but the way information is presented in digestible and approachable while also being somewhat dense content-wise. The writing style also helps a lot, as it feels very informal and friendly, lending to the approachability aspect of the site as a whole. It also manages to clarify topics that may be obscure for the average viewer without almsot any extraneous content, which I think really helps the viewer follow along.</p>
